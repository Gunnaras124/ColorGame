🎨 ColorGame

Where your brain betrays you in under 30 seconds.

🧠 What Is This?

ColorGame is a deceptively simple typing game designed to:

Confuse your eyes

Gaslight your brain

Destroy your confidence in basic color recognition

You are shown a word, colored in a different color, and asked to type…
the color of the text, not the word itself.

Yes.
It is harder than it sounds.

⏱️ How To Play

Stare at the screen confidently.

Press Enter to begin.

A color name appears.

Ignore the word.

Type the color of the text.

Regret everything.

You have 30 seconds.
No mercy. No pause button. Just vibes.

🎯 Scoring System

Correct color? +1 point

Wrong color?
Nothing happens, but you know.

The game doesn’t insult you.
It lets silence do the damage.

🧪 Psychology Warning

This game exploits the Stroop Effect, a psychological phenomenon where:

Your brain reads words faster than it processes colors

Translation:
You are fighting biology.
